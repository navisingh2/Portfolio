    <h2>My Quarantine</h2>
    <p>
        Hello all! Due to COVID-19, I had more free time to explore activities during quarantine. I picked
        up baking/cooking, painting, and reading books - all of which I didn't have time to do during the 
        school year.

        I made a lot chocolate scones using my cooking teacher's recipe (posted below)!

          Before all the stores closed down, I made sure to buy some paint and paper in case the lockdown was longer
          than expected (which it unfortunately was). I found my inspiration through the Instagram artist 
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/boelterdesignco/?hl=en">@boelterdesignco</a>! I focused my  paintings 
          towards nature and landscape. I felt very relaxed while, and all of my attention was focused on these
          illustrations!
