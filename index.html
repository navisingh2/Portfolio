    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Navi Singh and I am from Broomall, Pennsylvania. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I am an upcoming senior at MNHS. I have been learning code since my freshman year of 
        high school. Since then, I have significantly improved my Java programming skills and have created several Java programs.
        For example, my final project for my AP CompSci class was a GPA calculator which catered to my school's credit
        and grading scale.
    
    </p>
